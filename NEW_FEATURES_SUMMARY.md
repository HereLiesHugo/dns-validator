# DNS Validator - New Advanced Features Summary

## üÜï Recently Added Features

### üåç Geolocation DNS Testing (`geo-dns`)
**Command:** `python dns_validator_cli.py geo-dns <domain>`

**Features:**
- Tests DNS resolution from 15+ geographic locations worldwide
- Detects GeoDNS routing patterns and load balancing
- Identifies CDN providers and endpoints automatically
- Compares response times across different regions
- Validates routing consistency across geographic locations
- Comprehensive geographic DNS analysis

**Locations Tested:**
- United States (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9, OpenDNS)
- Germany, United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Canada
- Netherlands, Singapore, Brazil, India, South Korea
- Russia, China

**Output Includes:**
- Success rate and response times per location

### ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer Health Checks (`load-balancer`)
**Command:** `python dns_validator_cli.py load-balancer <domain>`

**Features:**
- Validates health of multiple A record endpoints
- TCP connectivity testing on common ports (80, 443, 22, 21, 25, 53)
- HTTP/HTTPS endpoint health verification
- Load balancing pattern analysis (round-robin vs weighted)
- Failover capability assessment
- Redundancy level evaluation (high/medium/low)
- Distribution consistency testing

**Health Checks:**
- TCP port connectivity (multiple ports)
- HTTP response validation (status codes, response times)
- HTTPS response validation (with SSL context handling)
- Overall endpoint health status determination

**Load Balancing Analysis:**
- Query distribution testing (10 consecutive queries)
- Balanced vs weighted distribution detection
- Health percentage calculation
- Failover readiness assessment

### üì° Enhanced IPv6 Support Validation (`ipv6-check`)
**Command:** `python dns_validator_cli.py ipv6-check <domain>`

**Features:**
- AAAA record validation and comprehensive analysis
- IPv6-only DNS server testing (6 major providers)
- Dual-stack configuration verification
- IPv6 connectivity testing (ping + TCP ports)
- DNS-over-IPv6 functionality validation
- IPv6 readiness scoring system (0-100 points)
- Detailed configuration recommendations
- Forward/reverse IPv6 consistency checks

**IPv6 DNS Servers Tested:**
- Google IPv6 (2001:4860:4860::8888, 2001:4860:4860::8844)
- Cloudflare IPv6 (2606:4700:4700::1111, 2606:4700:4700::1001)
- Quad9 IPv6 (2620:fe::fe)
- OpenDNS IPv6 (2620:119:35::35)

**Configuration Types Detected:**
- Dual-Stack (IPv4 + IPv6) - Recommended
- IPv4-Only - Needs IPv6 implementation
- IPv6-Only - Consider IPv4 for compatibility
- No DNS Records - Configuration issue

**Readiness Scoring (0-100):**
- AAAA records present: 40 points
- Dual-stack configuration: 30 points
- DNS over IPv6 working: 20 points
- IPv6 connectivity: 10 points

- Load balancer endpoint health failures
- SSL certificate validation for IP addresses

### Cross-Platform Compatibility:
- Windows/Linux/macOS ping command detection
- IPv6 socket handling across different operating systems
- SSL context creation for IP-based HTTPS testing
- Terminal output formatting with proper color codes
